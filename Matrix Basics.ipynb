    "A matrix defines a **linear transformation** of coordinate space. What makes the transformation “linear” is that lines which were straight before the transformation remain straight after the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, Cairo only supports a *subset* of linear transformations: these are the **affine transformations**, which are further restricted in that straight lines which were parallel before the transformation remain parallel afterwards. The linear transformations that are excluded from this set are the *perspective distortions*.\n",

    "Cairo provides for directly constructing transformations of the following kinds:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *translation* — a change of position.\n",
    "* *scaling* — a change of size. If the scale factors along the $x$- and $y$-axes are different, then this is a *nonuniform* scaling; if they are the same, the scaling is *uniform*.\n",
    "* *rotation* — a change of orientation.\n",

The direction of the translation depends not just on the orientation, but on the order in which you apply the transformations: in other words, on whether you apply the translation before or after the rotation.\n",
