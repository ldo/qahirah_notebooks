This repository contains [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks using Python code to explain various concepts to do with the [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) 2D graphics library. Cairo calls are made using the Qahirah ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/qahirah), [GitHub](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah)) high-level binding for Python 3. Several of the figures can be interactively animated.

If you are new to Jupyter/IPython, use the command

> jupyter notebook

in the current directory to start a Jupyter session. Jupyter’s mini webserver will listen on port 8888 on your local machine; connect using your web browser to see the available notebooks to open them and start interacting with them. In particular, click in a Python code cell and press shift-enter to execute the code. The code cells in these notebooks are designed to be executed in sequence. Or, if you’re lazy, you can do “Cell → Run All” when you open a notebook.

More information is available via the Help menu in the notebook browser window.
