    "\n",
    "[Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) is a powerful 2D graphics API, with many useful capabilities. Qahirah is a Cairo wrapper for Python which tries to take advantage of Python’s language versatility. The aim of Qahirah is to produce a binding that makes Cairo look as though it was written for Python. If you find the [Cairo reference material](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/) a bit overwhelming, hopefully this notebook will shed some light on at least the basics."

    "\n",
    "The Cairo API consists of a number of different object types, represented in Qahirah by corresponding Python classes. The core of them is the _surface_ and the _context_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _surface_ (type [`cairo_surface_t`](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-cairo-surface-t.html) in Cairo, class `Surface` in Qahirah) holds the result of drawing. There are different types of surfaces, perhaps the most common being an [_image surface_](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Image-Surfaces.html), represented by the `ImageSurface` type in Qahirah. This holds a two-dimensional array of pixels, of a specified width, height and format. Other surface types allow rendering directly to file formats such as PDF and SVG, but this introduction will concentrate on image surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Cairo supports different [formats](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Image-Surfaces.html#cairo-format-t) of image surfaces, the most common ones you are likely to encounter are `CAIRO.IMAGE_FORMAT_RGB24` and `CAIRO.IMAGE_FORMAT_ARGB32` (to use their names in Qahirah). The former includes 8 bits in a pixel for each of the red, green and blue components of the colour, while the latter adds 8 bits of _alpha transparency_ , which can be used to produce overlay effects."

    "## Basic Geometry: Paths ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapes drawn in Cairo are represented as [_paths_](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Paths.html). Cairo itself provides very limited tools for manipulating these, but Qahirah wraps them in its own `Path` class, which offers a lot more.\n",
    "\n",
    "A path consists of one or more disjoint _segments_ , each of which is defined by a connected series of straight lines and curves. A segment may be _closed_ , in which case the end point of the last line or curve is implicitly joined to the start point of the first line or curve, or it may be _open_ , in which case no such joining is implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually draw pixels into a surface, the path has to be either _filled_ or _stroked_. _Filling_ a path means drawing the current source colour or pattern into its interior bounds, while _stroking_ means the source colour or pattern is used to draw a line of specified thickness along the path. (Note that filling an open path actually causes it to be treated as a _closed_ path.)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Coordinates_ of points in Cairo are specified as pairs of floating-point numbers $(x, y)$. In the _default_ coordinate system, $x$ values increase from left to right, while $y$ values increase from top to bottom, with $(x, y) = (0, 0)$ located at the top left of the drawing surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "When drawing into an `ImageSurface` with the default transformation, these coordinates map directly to pixel positions, rounded to the nearest integer. However, the ability to specify fractional coordinates is actually very useful, when doing _resolution-independent_ drawing. This will become apparent later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cairo, path construction is done by specifying point coordinates as separate _x_ and _y_ arguments. In Qahirah, these are combined into a single `Vector` object. More will be divulged about this later, but for now, just note the need for an extra pair of parentheses around coordinate argument pairs.\n"

    "\n",
    "So far, we have seen use of some predefined colours from the [traditional X11 set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names) to do our drawing. Cairo itself allows specification of arbitrary colours as [_(red, green, blue, alpha)_ tuples](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-cairo-t.html#cairo-set-source-rgba), where each component is a floating-point value in the range &#91;0,&nbsp;1&#93; (the alpha component can be omitted if it is 1). However, this is not always the most convenient way to define colours. Thus, Qahirah defines a more elaborate `Colour` class which, in addition to _(r, g, b, a)_ components, also allows colours to be specified in terms of _(h, s, v, a)_ , _(h, l, s, a)_ and _(y, i, q, a)_ components, taking advantage of the conversions provided by the standard Python [`colorsys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/colorsys.html) module. And there is a convenience method for creating pure greyscales. Plus of course the aforementioned X11 colour names.\n",

This is because I often see nearly identical calculations written out twice, once to compute _x_ and once to compute _y_. Isn’t it much less effort to just write things out once? Consider the case of computing a point at a given distance and direction from an initial point. This can be done with conventional scalar arithmetic as\n",

    "## Basic Coordinate Transformations ##\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite common for a figure to occur multiple times in a drawing. The instances might be in different locations, but they can also be rotated into different orientations, or scaled to different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than try to compute the coordinates directly every time you draw the figure, Cairo can do that for you, by applying a _coordinate transformation_ to the drawing context. Then the code that produces that figure can use a simple fixed set of coordinate numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer graphics parlance, the figure is defined in its own _object coordinate system_ , and each instance undergoes a separate transformation to the _world coordinate system_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conjunction with this, it can be convenient to use the `save()` and `restore()` methods in a `Context`, so that changes to the coordinate system can be restricted to just part of the drawing. Changes to other context settings also get bracketed in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that rotation angles are defined such that 0° is oriented along the positive $x$-axis, while 90° points along the positive $y$-axis. In the default coordinate system, this means that positive rotation angles are _clockwise_ , while negative angles go _anticlockwise_. But this can change if you apply a scaling transformation where the sign of one axis is flipped but not the other."

    "It is very common in computer graphics to restrict drawing to just part of the picture. For example, you might be drawing an outside scene visible through a window, some objects of which may only be partly visible. Rather than try to work out how to draw just a _part_ of these objects, it is often easier to define the window frame as a _clipping region_ , and simply draw the entire object; the parts that lie outside the clipping region (hidden by the window edge) do not appear, and existing parts of the drawing in that area remain unchanged instead of being overwritten.\n",

    "## Path Objects ##\n",
    "\n",
    "It should already be clear that paths are a very fundamental concept in the Cairo graphics model. So it is surprising to see that Cairo itself does not provide much in the way of facilities for manipulating them. But never fear, because Qahirah fills that gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paths are built up in Cairo out of `new_sub_path()`, `move_to()`, `line_to()`, `curve_to()` and `close_path()` calls. (Other shapes like arcs, circles and rectangles are ultimately built out of these same primitives.) Qahirah wraps Cairo’s `copy_path()` call to return a pure-Python `Path` object. It also provides means to construct `Path` objects directly, without using Cairo’s calls, and therefore without having to create a drawing `Context`. Of course, such `Path`s can be passed back to Cairo, where it is expecting one of its own `cairo_path_t` objects; Qahirah will perform the necessary conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qahirah’s `Path` objects consist of a sequence of `Path.Segment` objects, each representing a sub-path. A `Path.Segment` can be constructed in terms of `MoveTo`, `LineTo`, `CurveTo` and `Close` analogues to Cairo’s path-construction calls, and it can also be decomposed into a sequence of such calls—these elements have become a very traditional way of thinking about paths, dating back to the old PostScript printing/graphics language.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the underlying representation of a `Path.Segment` is actually in terms of a sequence of `Path.Point` objects: each contains a `Vector` representing its coordinates, together with an _off-curve_ flag: a value of `False` for this flag indicates that the path passes through this point, while a value of `True` indicates that it is an intermediate control point for a Bézier curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a succession of two on-curve points defines a straight line; if there is one off-curve point in-between, then this is a _quadratic_ Bézier segment, and if there are two off-curve points in-between the on-curve points, then this is a _cubic_ Bézier segment (more than two off-curve points in succession are not allowed). The segment also has a flag indicating whether it is open or closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation for paths lends itself to many useful manipulations. For example, it is easy to reverse the direction of a path, and determine the orientation (clockwise or anticlockwise) of a path segment.\n"
