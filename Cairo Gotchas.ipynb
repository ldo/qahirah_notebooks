The *untransformed* extents correctly match the *axis-aligned* bounds of the transformed path, while the *transformed* extents reflect the bounds of the *untransformed extents aligned to the transformed axes*. So Cairo is computing, not the bounds of the path, but the bounds of the bounds of the path!\n",

    "Does this behaviour make sense? I don’t think it does. As I understand it, the way that Cairo does path construction is that each point is immediately transformed through the CTM and stored in world coordinates. That’s fine. But the logical way to compute the extents is to put each point through the *inverse* of the CTM, and then work out the minima and maxima along each axis of the resulting coordinates. The caller would then have to put the resulting bounding rectangle through the CTM again to get it to align correctly with the path. This, I think, would be a less surprising, and more useful, result overall."

This copy is not automatically updated for subsequent changes to the CTM, but only when a new source pattern is set. That way, different objects drawn subsequently with different transformations (but without touching the source setting) will have their repeats of the source pattern join up nicely.\n",

But beware of one or two pitfalls:\n",

In PostScript, the graphics state that is saved and restored includes the current path under construction; in Cairo, it does not."
