The main reason is that, in a Bézier curve, **every control point affects the entire curve**. Thus, in a higher-order Bézier, trying to juggle lots of control points makes it quite hard to shape the curve the exact way you want.\n",

That is, a cubic Bézier can exactly express any curve that a quadratic can (and then some), and a quadratic Bézier (and hence a cubic Bézier) can also exactly represent any straight line. Cairo provides straight-line segments as a separate path element type more for convenience and efficiency than anything else."

This decomposes the original Bézier into a series of pieces that, when drawn in sequence, are geometrically equivalent to the original curve. Even though the orders of the sub-curves remain the same (splitting a cubic Bézier yields cubic Béziers), the smaller they are, the closer they become to straight lines joining the endpoints. if a sub-curve lies everywhere within the tolerance of such a straight line, it is replaced by that line. Otherwise, the algorithm is applied recursively to split the sub-curve into two sub-sub-curves. And so on."

If they are also the same distance from the endpoint, then the continuity goes to $C^2$/$G^2$ (second order). This means that the amount of curvature does not suddenly change across the join.\n",

    "This second-order continuity has a number of practical applications. For example, if the curve were a railway track, and you were a passenger on a train carriage crossing that point at a constant speed, you would not experience any sudden lurching change in acceleration. For another example, if two separate curve segments in the shape of a car body meet with less than second-order continuity, then reflections will appear broken across the join; they will only be smooth if the continuity is second-order."
